Our validator provides large holders with the additional security, insight, and support levels required to protect the value of their assets. We define large holders as an individual or group with more than 100,000 Atoms. Staking Returns As a holder of ATOMs you'll need to bond your stake to a validator like Mythos to earn rewards. You\u2019ll start receiving rewards as soon as your ATOMs are bonded. Rewards There are two types of rewards for staking: Rewards Type Factors Denomination Block Provisions (inflation of ATOM supply) - Cosmos global inflation rate - Total amount of ATOMs staked - Block time interval ATOMs Fee Rewards (transaction fees) - Number of Cosmos transactions - Gas Fees paid for Cosmos transactions ATOMs (and various tokens) Cosmos global inflation rate is adaptive with issuance fluctuating between 7% to 20% of annual supply During the early phases of Cosmos, Block Provisions will make up the bulk of rewards. As usage of the Cosmos network increases we expect Fee Rewards to make up a larger percentage of total rewards. Costs There are also costs incurred for staking: Cost Type Factors Denomination Validator Commission (paid to your validator) Commission fee charged by your validator ATOMs (and various tokens) These fees ensure validators like Mythos can provide high quality infrastructure and suppport for the Cosmos community. Risks It's important to select a high quality validator because there are risks in staking: Risk Type Description Penalty Double-sign Slashing If validator signs block twice, stake bonded to validator is slashed. After this occurs all delegates are automatically unbounded and cannot rebond for a three week period. This can occur if validator keys compromised - 5% stake slash - Opportunity cost of missing rewards during 3-week unbond Downtime Slashing If a validator does not sign a block within 10,000 blocks (which equates to about half a day to a day of consecutive downtime), any stake bonded to validator is slashed and the validator is \u201cjailed\u201d for 10 minutes - 0.01% stake slash - Opportunity cost of missing rewards during 10 mins jailed period Fortunately Mythos has developed systems and procedures to mitigate the risk of slashing. Net Rewards The net rewards for staking are: Net Rewards = (Block Provisions + Fee Rewards) - (Validator Commission) Reward Payout Rewards are paid out on a per block basis, which is generally every 5-7 seconds. Stakers can withdraw or re-bond their rewards as they are accrued. Staking Example\u00b6 Say you delegate 100,000 ATOMs to the Mythos validator with commission fee of 15%. Assume 55% of ATOMs are currently staking, a 7% Global Inflation Rate, Average Block Time of 5 seconds, your expected reward return is 10.82% annualized or 10,818 ATOMs per year after validator commission fees. And if you automatically re-bond your rewards when they are received, your annualized return increases to 11.43% or 11,425 ATOMs. Optimizing Rewards The best way to optimize rewards is through careful validator selection and to re-bond your rewards frequently. We recommend the following: Minimize slashing risk by staking with a diversified portfolio of 3-5 trusted validators with a history of uptime, no jail occurrences, and a setup that maximizes for double sign protection Ensure a reasonable commission rate when you select your validators. As with anything, look for reasonable commission costs. The lowest cost providers may not be the highest quality and the highest cost providers may not be efficiently optimized. Re-Bond often to compound your rewards. Compounding is the secret to wealth accrual and compounding ATOMs by re-bonding your rewards is essential to increase your annualized Cosmos rewards.

See official Cosmos documents for more information. How do you stake with Mythos? 1. Does Mythos take custody of my ATOMS during delgation? No, Mythos does not take custody of your ATOMS tokens through the delegation process. You maintain access to your private keys through your designated wallet. 2. How do I stake with Mythos? See our Cosmos staking guide here . 3. What are Mythos fees for delegation? Our fees are subject to change but can always be found here . 4. How often can I withdraw my rewards? Rewards are provided by the Cosmos protocol on a per block basis, which is generally every 5-7 seconds. Stakers can withdrawl rewards at any time. We also encourage stakers to re-bond their rewards in order to compound their returns. 5. How long does it take to unbond my ATOMs once staked? Once staked, your ATOMs are locked. Unlocking them will required you to send an unbonding transaction. It will take 3 weeks (21 days) from the time of your unbounding transaction until funds are unlocked. 6. How do I re-delegate from another validator to Mythos? You can instantly re-delegate your ATOMs from an existing validator to Mythos. Instructions for this can be found here . Definition(s) Global Inflation Rate Cosmos global inflation rate is adaptive with issuance fluctuating between 7% to 20% of annual supply. If the total bonded stake is greater than 66% of the Atom supply, inflation decreases until it reaches 7%. If the total bonded stake is less than 66% of the Atom supply, the annual inflation increase up to 20%. The rate gradually fluctuates between these amounts depending on total bonded amounts.","title":"FAQ for Cosmos"},{"location":"cosmos/cosmos-faq/#how-to-stake-loom-with-mythos","text":"Mythos specific questions posted below.

In the future you\u2019ll be able to stake via the official Cosmos Wallet and also directly through the Mythos website using a Ledger wallet. The Cosmos Wallet has not yet passed its security audit, so is currently not recommended for staking. We expect Cosmos to add staking support from its Wallet soon. Requirements for Staking ATOM Tokens A Ledger hardware wallet Note: Since ATOMs are not yet available on exchanges and cannot yet be transferred stakers must have ATOMs from Cosmos Fundraiser in Genesis file in order to stake NOTE: The private keys to your ATOMs do not leave your custody during the delegation process. Mythos will never need to take possession of your ATOMs. Staking ATOMs via CLI We assume the following in this tutorial: Using Windows, MacOS, or Linux Staker has ability to run commands via Command-Line interface Staker has a Ledger hardware wallet Note for Fundraiser participants Cosmos had a fundraiser that ended on April 6 th 2017. If you participated you can access your ATOMs on a Ledger using the seed words (12 words) that you generated in the fundraiser event. You can do this on blank Ledger by choosing the \u201cRestore Configuration\u201d option during Ledger setup and entering in your Cosmos seed words. Alternately, if you have an existing Ledger you can reset the device (make sure you back up your Ledger seed words in case of error) and enter your Cosmos seed words when prompted to \u201cEnter your recovery phrase\u201d. 1. Prepare your CLI environment You\u2019ll need the Cosmos SDK including gaidd and gaiacli installed in order to delegate via CLI. To install, please follow the Gaia installation instructions here . After installation confirm you have successfully installed gaia by running this command: $ gaiacli version --long The output should resemble something similar to this: \u279c cosmos-sdk: 0.33.0 git commit: 7b4104aced52aa5b59a96c28b5ebeea7877fc4f0 vendor hash: 5db0df3e24cf10545c84f462a24ddc61882aa58f build tags: netgo ledger go version go1.12 linux/amd64 2. Prepare your Ledger and Import Keys To prepare your Ledger for delegation, you must have the latest version of Ledger Live software installed. Once Ledger Live in installed and updated, connect your Ledger via USB and ensure the Ledger device itself is upgraded to the latest firmware. Now, go to the Ledger Live Manager and download the \u201cCosmos\u201d application. This will take a few moments. Once the Cosmos application is installed, you can navigate to the application using the interface on your Ledger to verify it has successfully installed. Leave the Ledger Connected and open the Cosmos application using your Ledger. Next, determine a name for your Cosmos Ledger keys and import the keys from your Ledger by running the following: $ gaiacli keys add keyName --ledger In place of keyName specify a name for your Cosmos Ledger keys, for example: MainCosmosAccount Check the accounts you have imported by running the following command: $ gaiacli keys list The output should resemble something similar to this: \u279c NAME: TYPE: ADDRESS: PUBKEY: MainCosmosAccount ledger cosmos1w42lm7zv55jrh5ggpecg0v643qeatfkdqf5ua6 cosmospub1addwnpepqfgfdpgjpqr9grjhvwhylqt3cldfkmnknl9tf2g0dtd0qh4vumfe5rqz57v Note: The address that begins with cosmos1 is your public key. Great! Your Ledger is now setup and ready to delegate ATOMs. 3. Connect to Node and Configure Connection Run the following command to connect to Mythos Cosmos full node: $ gaiacli config node cosmoshub-1.mythos.services:26657 Now configure your connection by running the following: $ gaiacli config trust-node false Ok, you are connected to the Mythos full node. 4. Determine Amounts and Run Delegation Command It's time to determine the amount of ATOMs you want to stake and set the gas price for your delegation transaction. Example: 100000000000uatoms to delegate (which is 100,000 Atoms) 1uatom as gas price (gas price can be minimal) Units are specified in uAtoms which is 1 millionth of an Atom. In order to convert an uAtom to an Atom divide the uAtom by 1,000,000. (E.g. 1,000,000 uAtoms = 1 Atom) Note: Don\u2019t delegate the full amount from your account. You\u2019ll want to keep an ATOM or so in your account to pay for gas fees which are required to withdraw and re-bond rewards Once you\u2019ve determined your staking amount, you can stake to Mythos by running a command similar to the following: $ gaiacli tx staking delegate validatorAddress amountToBond uatom --from delegatorKeyName --gas auto --gas-prices amountGas uatom --chain-id cosmoshub-1 For validatorAddress use the Mythos validator address cosmosvaloper1w42lm7zv55jrh5ggpecg0v643qeatfkd9aqf3f For amountToBond specify the number of uAtoms to delegate. For delegatorKeyName use the key name you specified when you imported your Ledger keys (e.g. MainCosmosAccount ) For amountGas add the gas price in uAtoms (1uAtom is probably sufficient) For example, to delegate 100,000 ATOMs to Mythos at a 1uAtom gas fee you'd run: $ gaiacli tx staking delegate cosmosvaloper1w42lm7zv55jrh5ggpecg0v643qeatfkd9aqf3f 100000000000uatom --from MainCosmosAccount --gas auto --gas-prices 1uatom --chain-id cosmoshub-1 Congrats! If you've successfully run this command you are now staking with Mythos. Confirming your stake You can search for your Cosmos address in Mintscan to see the staking transaction and your account details. Withdrawing rewards Rewards are accrued on a per block basis and you can withdraw your rewards at any time. The command to withdraw rewards is: $ gaiacli tx distr withdraw-all-rewards --from delegatorKeyName Where delegatorKeyName is the key name you specified when you imported your Ledger keys. Re-bonding Rewards You'll want to re-bond your rewards on a frequent basis in order to compound your returns. While automated re-bonding capabilities will be added to wallets soon, for now you'll need to manually withdraw your rewards and use the instructions above to bond your rewards. Need Additional Help?

To stake, all you need are some LOOM tokens in a supported Ethereum wallet that contains both the LOOM tokens and also a bit of ETH to pay for Ethereum transactions. NOTE: The private keys to your LOOM do not leave your custody during the delegation process. Mythos will never need to take possession of your LOOM. Requirements for Staking LOOM Tokens An Ethereum Wallet (either Metamask or Ledger - new ) A bit of ETH in your wallet to pay for transactions A NOTE ON LEDGER SUPPORT Ledger support is now available but is currently in Beta mode. If you choose to use Ledger right now, expect some bumps in the process. (By bumps we mean errors, slowness, and inability to delegate from Ledger, but these errors will NOT result in a loss of LOOM funds) The Ledger does NOT work through Metamask's Ledger support , so you'll need to use Ledger directly with the DappChain web interface. There is a bug in a previous verions of Chrome (Chrome 72) and older Chromium-based browsers (Brave and Opera) that could inhibit Ledger transactions with the LOOM interface. Make sure you update to the latest browser version before you begin. Mythos Staking Tutorial 1. Create a PlasmaChain account Navigate to the Plasmachain Dashboard and setup an account. Confirm you've navigated to the correct website by verifying the security certificate (check the padlock symbol next to URL). Click \u201cNew User\u201d to setup your account. (If you already have an account, click \"Returning User\" and restore account with your 12 word recovery phrase) You\u2019ll now be instructed to store your 12 word recovery seed phrase. Follow the directions and store these immediately. These 12 seed words are the only way to restore your Plasmachain account in the event you lose access. Store them accordingly and do not lose them! Next, you\u2019ll be asked to confirm three of the 12 words you stored. 2. Select your Wallet After you confirm the seed words you'll need to select your Wallet, either Ledger or Metamask. (Read our note on Ledger support ) Staking from a Metamask Skip this section if you are staking from Ledger. Make sure Metamask is installed. (There are many good tutorials on how to setup Metamask if this is your first time.) Make sure you have LOOM tokens in your Metamask wallet along with enough ETH gas for a few transactions. Make sure you are logged into Metamask. Above: Metamask wallet with ETH for gas and LOOM ready to stake Now, select Metamask \"Connect and sign via your browser extension\". After selecting, you may be prompted to connect your PlasmaChain account to your Ethereum address on the Ledger. Click \"Connect\" on the Metamask dialog to do so. Awesome! You have connected your PlasmaChain account to your Metamask wallet. You are now ready to deposit LOOM tokens into the Plasmachain. Staking from a Ledger Ignore this section if you are staking from Metamask. First, you'll need to ensure your Ledger is updated to the latest Firmware version and Ethereum wallet app via the Ledger Live application. Make sure you have LOOM tokens in your Ledger Ethereum wallet along with enough ETH gas for a few transactions. Make sure your Ledger is connected to your machine via USB. Make sure you have \" Contract data \" on in your Ledger under the Ethereum app settings. Make sure you have \"Display data\" off in your Ledger under the Ethereum app settings. Make sure you are using a supported browser, an older version of Chrome (not Chrome 72), or an older version of Opera or Brave. You may decide to downgrade your browser . Now, select Ledger \"Connect and sign via your hardware wallet\". You should now see a list of Ethereum wallets on your Ledger. There are two types of Ledger Ethereum address formats. \"Ledger (Legacy)\" was previously default for Ledger devices. The second type \"Ledger Live\" is now the default Ethereum address when setting up via the Ledger Live application. If you do not see your Ethereum address under \"Ledger (Legacy)\" switch to \"Ledger Live\" by editing the \"Ledger (Legacy)\" textbox and selecting \"Ledger Live\" to load additional Ethereum addresses. Once you find your Ethereum address, select it and click Proceed. Awesome! You have now connected your PlasmaChain account to your Ledger. You are now ready to deposit LOOM tokens into the Plasmachain. 3. Deposit LOOM into the Plasmachain After creating your account and selecting your wallet you will be taken to the Plasmachain Account page. Now you'll need to connect to the Plasmachain by mapping to your wallet account. Click \u201cMap Accounts\u201d and sign the corresponding transaction to complete the mapping. If using Metamask, confirm the transaction on Metamask popup dialog If using Ledger, approve the \"Sign the message\" transaction on Ledger interface Now, type in the amount of LOOM you want to stake next to the Deposit button. When complete click \u201cDeposit\u201d and confirm the transaction(s). If using Metamask, confirm the first transaction, wait until it completes, then confirm the second transaction in Metamask dialog after it pops up. If using Ledger, a transaction approval will appear on the Ledger interface. Depending on your settings, several approvals may be required. Review details and approve. Metamask Transaction: Your first transaction may take a few minutes to process. After this transaction processes, a second contract transaction will require your approval via Metamask. Gas Fee on Ledger: There is no option to manually select gas for transaction, but gas charges were minimal during our tests ranging from 0.0000943908 to 0.000136728 ETH. Having difficulties with Ledger? See Troubleshooting Ledger section. Once the deposit transactions process, the amount of LOOM in the Dappchain portion of the header will increment to reflect the amount you just deposited. Ok, your LOOM is in the Dappchain. You are ready to Stake. 4. Delegate to Mythos Now click \u201cValidators\u201d in the left navigation panel of the Dashboard and select \u201cMythos\u201d. Once the Mythos validator page loads you\u2019ll see a \u201cDelegate\u201d button. Click it, select the amount you wish to Delegate, and your preferred Locktime / Bonus. The greater the Locktime / Bonus, the more LOOM rewards you will receive. See LOOM Overview for details on how Locktime affects your returns. Click \"Delegate\" again once you have filled in the amount and selected your Locktime. Congratulations! Your LOOM stake to Mythos is now in queue. Once the next election cycle completes your LOOM will be successfully staked with Mythos. You can monitor the election cycle countdown in the top left of the Plasmachain dashboard. 5. Confirm Delegation After the election cycle is complete confirm your Delegation by clicking the \u201cMy Delegations\u201d link. There you will see the details of your Delegation. Great work. Mythos is glad to have you as a delegate! If you haven't already done so, take a minute to signup for our newsletter so you don't miss any LOOM related updates. About Rewards and Withdrawals Every two week cycle you can expect to receive staking rewards denominated in LOOM. You can withdraw your rewards on the Rewards page at any time after they are available. To maximize your returns and compound them, we recommend you stake your rewards with Mythos or another qualified validator as soon as you receive them. About Unstaking You can also un-delegate from Mythos through the Dashboard. However, remember that your locktime period will influence when you can withdrawal your staked LOOM tokens. Any LOOM that is locked cannot be withdrawn until the locking period has expired. About Changing Validators LOOM will be adding the ability to change validators during your locktime period so that you're not locked into a specific validator for the duration of your locktime. Stakers will have the ability switch their LOOM stake from one validator to another for any reason. Switching will likely occur during bonding periods every two weeks. Ledger Troubleshooting Tips Ledger support is a bit rough right now, but both LOOM and Ledger are actively working to address. Here are some issues we ran into when staking from a Ledger. A Ledger transaction did not appear when attempting to Deposit to Plasmachain Make sure you are running the latest Ledger firmware and have installed the latest Ethereum wallet from the newest version of Ledger Live. Make sure Contract data is set to On in your Ledger application settings. Also, make sure you are not using Chrome 72 or a Chromium version in Opera or Brave that is currently broken with Ledger. We had the most success using Ledger with an older version of Opera. When depositing to Plasmachain, Ledger is prompting me for too many transaction and parameter confirmations This will occur if you have Display data set to On in your Ledger application. The multiple parameter requests on Ledger interface seem to cause a timeout which triggers an error when depositing to Plasmachain. To resolve, turn Display data to Off in Ledger by navigating to Settings in the Ledger Ethereum application and try again. Stalled on \"Please be patient, Loomy is on it\" after approval of deposit transaction on Ledger It may take several minutes for the Ethereum transaction to be included in a block. During this time the \"Please be patient...\" Loomy message will be displayed. To see the status of your transaction, go to Etherscan and look up your Ethereum address. You should see a LOOM transaction with a pending status. After this transaction is successful your LOOM deposit should appear in the Plasmachain. Interface in Ledger stalls or becomes slow to respond We experienced some slowness in the Ledger interface while connected to the Dappchain using a Ledger. In general, the slowness was temporarily resolved by removing the Ledger and re-logging into the Plasmachain. You may find it takes several logins to complete your interaction with the Dappchain using a Ledger. We expect future updates will resolve this. Need Additional Help?

You can withdraw your rewards on the Rewards page at any time after they are available. To maximize your returns and compound them, we recommend you stake your rewards with Mythos or another qualified validator as soon as you receive them.","title":"About Rewards and Withdrawals"},{"location":"loom/loom-how/#about-unstaking","text":"You can also un-delegate from Mythos through the Dashboard. However, remember that your locktime period will influence when you can withdrawal your staked LOOM tokens. Any LOOM that is locked cannot be withdrawn until the locking period has expired.","title":"About Unstaking"},{"location":"loom/loom-how/#about-changing-validators","text":"LOOM will be adding the ability to change validators during your locktime period so that you're not locked into a specific validator for the duration of your locktime. Stakers will have the ability switch their LOOM stake from one validator to another for any reason. Switching will likely occur during bonding periods every two weeks.","title":"About Changing Validators"},{"location":"loom/loom-how/#ledger-troubleshooting-tips","text":"Ledger support is a bit rough right now, but both LOOM and Ledger are actively working to address. Here are some issues we ran into when staking from a Ledger. A Ledger transaction did not appear when attempting to Deposit to Plasmachain Make sure you are running the latest Ledger firmware and have installed the latest Ethereum wallet from the newest version of Ledger Live. Make sure Contract data is set to On in your Ledger application settings. Also, make sure you are not using Chrome 72 or a Chromium version in Opera or Brave that is currently broken with Ledger. We had the most success using Ledger with an older version of Opera. When depositing to Plasmachain, Ledger is prompting me for too many transaction and parameter confirmations This will occur if you have Display data set to On in your Ledger application. The multiple parameter requests on Ledger interface seem to cause a timeout which triggers an error when depositing to Plasmachain. To resolve, turn Display data to Off in Ledger by navigating to Settings in the Ledger Ethereum application and try again. Stalled on \"Please be patient, Loomy is on it\" after approval of deposit transaction on Ledger It may take several minutes for the Ethereum transaction to be included in a block. During this time the \"Please be patient...\" Loomy message will be displayed. To see the status of your transaction, go to Etherscan and look up your Ethereum address. You should see a LOOM transaction with a pending status. After this transaction is successful your LOOM deposit should appear in the Plasmachain. Interface in Ledger stalls or becomes slow to respond We experienced some slowness in the Ledger interface while connected to the Dappchain using a Ledger. In general, the slowness was temporarily resolved by removing the Ledger and re-logging into the Plasmachain. You may find it takes several logins to complete your interaction with the Dappchain using a Ledger. We expect future updates will resolve this.","title":"Ledger Troubleshooting &amp; Tips"},{"location":"loom/loom-how/#need-additional-help","text":"If you need help, one of our agents will be happy to assist you, just contact us .
